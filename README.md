hello folks , my name is demian and you're probably here from ponytown!
this is just a small overview of my boundaries and extra info. please read it if you plan on interacting with me, it's not only appreciated but can also stop drama/misunderstandings!!

꩜ i am always okay with c+h but conversation might be awkward if you try. unless you can see me sitting and talking with friends, feel free to come say hi and interact!

꩜ if you randomly approach me and start booping, i will likely ignore you (if i'm on tab).

꩜ inspiration from my skins is fine and asking is unnecessary, but i don't allow copying & i won't be afraid to confront you on it.

꩜ i DO NOT RESPECT touch trigger/touch discomfort. i actively make fun of it.

꩜ i do not accept random friend requests!!! please at least sit with me first!!! >_<
